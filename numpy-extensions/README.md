## Description

Convenience scripts for methods that numpy does not have but would be useful to not have reimplement multiple times in different projects.

###### pca.py

This script has PCA class that performs principal component analysis on numpy array. I used this to play around with [Eigenfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenface) and an idea for a image generating neural network that created realistic faces based on different weighted combinations of Eigenfaces.
