# Linalg or "Dumbpy"

## Description

This project was built for fun the summer after (2019) I took linear algebra since I enjoyed the course so much. It does not use the most efficient methods and should not be used for real projects or numerical linear algebra with large matrices. All methods have comments describing behavior, needed inputs, and output.
